 # Motivation and purpose


The motivation for making this application was purly for self-education although i had a lot of fun.


---

# So what did i learn?




Its difficult to pinpoint exactly what i learned as i think it was many things.
but atleast here are a few things...


***How to acces functions from other functions***

***What callback-functions are***

***I understood a bit more about querySelectorAll***

***Session storage***

***how to grab numbers and compare them***

**There is so much more that i learned and i am really loocking forward to my next project**

---

# The hard way!




I realize there is problely several moore easier ways i could have done this.

to name one, instead of showind and hiding divs for showing and hiding cards i could have used css instead.

# Final words




**Improvments, Features, updates**
there are several improvements that can be made, for instance a better scoring representaion
player vs player and so forth.

I dont amadgen i will come back to this and make any improvements since this was for learning only.<br>
but for fun i just might.
